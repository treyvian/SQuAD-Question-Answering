## Transfer learning sentence embbeding 

SBERT can be used for information retrieval, clustering, automatic essay scoring, and for semantic textual similarity with incredible time and high accuracy. However, the limitation of SBERT is that it only supports English at the moment while leave blank for other languages. To solve that, we can use the model architecture similar with Siamese and Triplet network structures to extend SBERT to new language [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09813).
